## 🚀 Deploy to GitHub Pages
> Deploy to `roars.dev/csconfs` (only for maintainers):

```bash
# In the project root, e.g., ~/git/csconfs/ and in the `main``
npm run deploy
```

  - The script handles deployment to the `gh-pages` branch. It will automatically build the project and push the changes to the `gh-pages` branch. So you don't need to push to the `gh-pages` branch manually.
